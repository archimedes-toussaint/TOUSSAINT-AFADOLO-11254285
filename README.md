ANALYSIS ON RED WINE DATASET

## Project Overview:

This project involves an exploratory data analysis of a wine quality dataset to identify insights and relationships between different chemical properties and quality ratings of wines. The data contains information on red wines. There are 11 chemical properties measured for each wine sample as well as a quality score between 0 and 10.

The goal of the analysis is to understand:

- The characteristics and distributions of the variables, especially quality ratings
- The relationships between chemical properties and quality scores
- The key factors that influence or correlate with wine quality

By visualizing the data through plots and graphs, we can explore patterns and trends that provide insights into the winemaking factors that affect quality.

Approach:

The general approach is to:

1. Load the wine dataset into a Pandas dataframe

2. Compute summary statistics to understand the distributions

3. Create visualizations like bar graph and scatter plots to study the relationships 
   between variables
   
4. Compute correlations to quantify the relationships

5. Analyze and discuss findings from the visual and statistical analysis

6. Draw conclusions about the key chemical factors that correlate with and influence wine 
   quality
   
I used  Pandas data analysis library  to load, process, and analyze the data.
I used Matplotlib visualization library  to plot  graphs.
