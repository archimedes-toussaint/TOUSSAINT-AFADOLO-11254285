    "There exists a slight positive association between alcohol content and quality, with wines containing higher alcohol levels generally receiving higher quality ratings. Nonetheless, this correlation is not particularly strong, implying that quality is not solely determined by alcohol content but is also influenced by other characteristics such as aroma, flavor, acidity, and tannins."
